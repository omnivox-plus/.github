## Hello fellow Quebecers

Always get tired of the very mid design of the Omnivox mobile application? or the very uncommon way of doing their javascript on their website? DON'T WORRY, we're here for you!!
We will try our best to make a new website, android application (I don't know if it's a good idea to make one for iOS since there's no alternative store or package downloading I think) and even a desktop app???
And the best of all... a documented REST API woohoo !!!! SO you could make a Discord bot to remind yourself to gtfo of bed because you'll miss your math class.

## Here's the incredible peoples that are working on this project
- [filouRE](https://github.com/filouRE) the frontend man
- [TaxMachine](https://github.com/TaxMachine) the API and mobile app man
